# Potential Enhancements

This document outlines potential improvements that can be made to demonstrate advanced software engineering practices.

## 1. Enhanced Error Handling & Custom Exceptions
- Create custom exception classes (EmployeeNotFoundException, InvalidEmployeeDataException)
- Global exception handler with @ControllerAdvice
- Consistent error response format with proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Add @Valid annotation to controller methods
- Custom validation for business rules (e.g., salary ranges, email format)
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Validation error responses with field-level details

## 3. Caching for Performance
- Add Spring Cache abstraction
- Cache frequently accessed data (all employees, top earners)
- Cache eviction on create/delete operations
- Configurable TTL for cache entries
- Redis integration for distributed caching

## 4. Enhanced Logging
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Performance logging (execution time for each endpoint)
- Audit logging for create/delete operations
- Log levels based on environment (DEBUG for dev, INFO for prod)
- ELK stack integration

## 5. API Documentation
- Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Document all endpoints with examples
- Response schemas and error codes
- Try-it-out functionality
- API versioning strategy

## 6. Health Checks & Monitoring
- Spring Actuator endpoints
- Custom health indicator for mock server connectivity
- Metrics collection (request count, response times)
- Readiness and liveness probes
- Prometheus metrics export

## 7. Rate Limiting on API Side
- Implement request throttling
- Per-client rate limits using IP or API keys
- Return 429 Too Many Requests with retry-after header
- Distributed rate limiting with Redis

## 8. Integration Tests
- Full integration tests with MockMvc
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Test rate limiting and retries
- Contract testing for API compatibility
- Load testing with JMeter

## 9. Configuration Management
- Externalize all configuration
- Environment-specific properties
- Feature flags for new functionality
- Encrypted sensitive configuration
- Spring Cloud Config integration

## 10. Async Processing
- Async endpoints using CompletableFuture
- Thread pool configuration
- Non-blocking I/O for better resource utilization
- WebFlux migration for reactive programming

## 11. Security Enhancements
- OAuth2/JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- API key management
- Request signing
- HTTPS enforcement

## 12. Database Integration
- Add persistence layer with JPA/Hibernate
- Database migrations with Flyway
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Read/write splitting

## 13. Event-Driven Architecture
- Publish events on employee changes
- Integration with message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- Event sourcing for audit trail
- CQRS pattern implementation

## 14. Containerization
- Dockerfile for both modules
- Docker Compose setup
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Helm charts
- CI/CD pipeline

## 15. Duplicate Prevention
- Check for duplicate employees before creation
- Configurable duplicate detection strategy
- Return 409 Conflict for duplicates
- Batch import with duplicate handling
